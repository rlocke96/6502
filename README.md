# 6502
6502 Based system


Originally created a simple 6502. Started with Ben Eater's videos (https://eater.net/) and design. Used a arduino to view it working. Then I switched to a design by Grant Searle's design http://searle.wales/ and went from there. This is a still work in progress.

I currently use https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/tree/master/asm/ehbasic in my system and working on making changes.
